
On the web page it is important to have some information on the whole day

Example:

 On 2nd of June

Departure 8:30am from Mappin Street with destination Cressbrook Hall http://www.cressbrookhall.co.uk

Programme for Retreat 

Dinner at  http://www.packhorselongstone.co.uk from 6:30pm onwards to 9 pm

Return to Mappin Street at approx 10:00pm 

What needs to be done:

1. Prepare the programme. For this I have given you access to the document with the participants and I have attached a draft incomplete programme and the programme from last time. I have allowed more time to Neil Amanda and Alessandra, this is in purpose but we can cut down if issues in scheduling.

2. Create a google group with all people that participate to the retreat, so we can email them at once, see: https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cics/groups

3. Design the web page with the information on the dat and the schedule.
